# Because not everything has to hit 0 dB.

## Known bugs

* Doesn't attentuate samples When "create multi sampled instruments is enabled" and you drag multiple samples to the sample list

## TODO

* Make the attenuation factor configurable (based on preview volume?)
* Apply it to instruments as well? xrni & plugins...
* Be smarter about attenuating... don't do it if the sample is already quiet
