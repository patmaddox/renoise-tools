# PhrasePhreak 0.1

Extract phrases with ease.

Adds a "Tools -> PhrasePhreak -> Extract Phrase" menu item, as well as a key
command with the same name.

If block mode is enabled, the command extracts a phrase within the block and
assigns it to the next available phrase slot. If block mode is not enabled, the
command extracts a phrase based on the current selection in the pattern editor.
